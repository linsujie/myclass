/*********************************************************************
  This is an example of the useage of the RK class. RK class is used
  to calculate the value of a 1D odered one differential equation f(x,y).
  where dy/dx=f(x,y)
  It is also useful when you only want to do integration numerically.

  All the differential equation odered larger than one can be
  calculated by sperated it to several one odered equation, for example,
          d2y/dx2=f(x,y,dy/dx)
  can be trans to:
          dy/dx=z
          dz/dx=f(x,y,z)
  and be calculated.
  However, I just found that I didn't considered about this before, so
  you can only deal with odered one situation now, I'll add the
  function for the high odered situation soon.
  What's more, be careful when you dealing with the value 0. It will
  easily cause problem.

  The way to pass the diff equation to the class is changed. The function below is examples:
  function1:
             dy/dx=y_1
             dy_1/dx=4*x^2*y+2*y
  We will return y at last, so this is equal to d^2y/dx^2=4*x^2+2*y.

  What's more, you can still get y_1 as the variable y in class RK is Public, by RKobj.y[1].

  function2:
             dy/dx=y*x*Aa

  function3:
             d^2y/dx^2=-dy/dx - y/x
